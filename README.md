2. Data_explor.R


If you already have a database with all your species/genus records proceed with:

##### Species Distribution Modeling Part

3. Clean_data.R
4. Run_models_all_Spec_array.R
5. Plot_results.R

##### Generate a Web map showing the results from the models

6. WebMap.R



##### Additional Scripts:
